In this computer assignment, we will analyze the results of an RNA-seq dataset. This is one type of high-dimensional -omics data that biomedical scientists frequently use. The raw RNA-seq data are sequence reads, but we will use the processed data from an RNA-seq experiment, often referred to as a count matrix. A count matrix contains for every sample (in the columns of the matrix) and every gene or transcript (in the rows of the matrix) the number of sequencing reads representing that gene or transcript (an integer, i.e., 0, 1, 2, 3, ...). The expression level of that gene is derived from the read count by correcting (normalization) for the total number of sequencing reads in a particular sample.

RNA-seq is often used to explore the function of a gene or the effect of a genetic variant. Since RNA-seq can survey the expression levels of all genes, it is well suited to obtain a global idea of the effect on the physiology of a cell and the biological processes affected. In this computer assignment, we will explore a dataset from mouse B-cells from TP53-/- knockout and wild-type mice. It is a two-factor experiment, because cells of both genotypes have been analyzed with or without being exposed to ionizing radiation (IR); thus, genotype and exposure to IR represent different factors in the experiment. The research paper describing this dataset is [Torelli et al., 2015, Oncotarget 6: 24611-24626](https://doi.org/10.18632/oncotarget.5232). The TP53 gene coding for the p53 protein is a well-known tumor suppressor gene. p53 is involved in the induction of apoptosis, senescence, cell cycle arrest and metabolic reprogramming. p53 is activated by double strand DNA breaks and routes cells to apoptosis when the DNA damage cannot be repaired anymore. TP53 mutation is one the most common driver of mutations in cancer, because TP53-deficient cells continue to proliferate, even after significant DNA damage. IR induces double strand DNA breaks and cell death (apoptosis) and is a well-known activator of p53. The authors used TP53-/- cells and wild-type cells to explore which part of the response of B-cells to IR is dependent on p53.

# Analysis of the differential gene expression

## Identification of the differentially expressed features

To be able to identify differential gene expression between wild-type and p53-null cells and between IR- and mock-treated cells, we need to normalise our data first. In the lecture you have seen TPM and RPKM normalization. Here we use a bit more advance way of normalizing data using the Variance Stabilization and Transformation (VST) method from the DESeq2 package and tool. (see [DESeq2 documentation](http://bioconductor.org/packages/devel/bioc/vignettes/DESeq2/inst/doc/DESeq2.html#collapsing-technical-replicates)). DESeq2 also runs the Differential Gene Expression (DGE) analysis, which has two basic tasks:

- Estimate the biological variance using the replicates for each condition
- Estimate the significance of expression differences between any two conditions

This expression analysis is estimated from read counts and attempts are made to correct for variability in measurements using replicates, that are absolutely essential for accurate results. 

> <details-title>Technical vs biological replicates</details-title>

> A technical replicate is an experiment which is performed once but measured several times (e.g. multiple sequencing of the same library). A biological replicate is an experiment performed (and also measured) several times.

{: .details}

Multiple factors with several levels can then be incorporated in the analysis describing known sources of variation (e.g. treatment, tissue type, gender, batches), with two or more levels representing the conditions for each factor. After normalization we can compare the response of the expression of any gene to the presence of different levels of a factor in a statistically reliable way.

In our example, we have samples with two varying factors that can contribute to differences in gene expression:

- Genotype (either wild-type or knock-out)
- Treatment (either IR or mock)

The effect of Ionizing Radiation (IR) is our primary interest. Later on, we will explore the differences in IR response between wild-type and knock-out cells and which genes are dependent on p53 for their response to IR.
We will now assign each sample to the right group

**DESeq2** generated 4 outputs:

- A table with the normalized counts for each gene (rows) in the samples (columns)
- A graphical summary of the results, useful to evaluate the quality of the experiment:

    1. A plot of the first 2 dimensions from a principal component analysis 

    2. Heatmap of the sample-to-sample distance matrix (with clustering) based on the normalized counts.

        The heatmap gives an overview of similarities and dissimilarities between samples: the color represents the distance between the samples. Dark blue means shorter distance, i.e. closer samples given the normalized counts.


    3. Dispersion estimates: gene-wise estimates (black), the fitted values (red), and the final maximum a posteriori estimates used in testing (blue)

        This dispersion plot is typical, with the final estimates shrunk from the gene-wise estimates towards the fitted estimates. Some gene-wise estimates are flagged as outliers and not shrunk towards the fitted value. The amount of shrinkage can be more or less than seen here, depending on the sample size, the number of coefficients, the row mean and the variability of the gene-wise estimates.

    4. Histogram of *p*-values for the genes in the comparison between the 2 levels of the 1st factor

    5. An [MA plot](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MA_plot):

        This displays the global view of the relationship between the expression change of conditions (log ratios, M), the average expression strength of the genes (average mean, A), and the ability of the algorithm to detect differential gene expression. The genes that passed the significance threshold (adjusted p-value < 0.1) are colored in red.

- A summary file with the following values for each gene:

    1. Gene identifiers
    2. Mean normalized counts, averaged over all samples from both conditions
    3. Fold change in log2 (logarithm base 2)

       The log2 fold changes are based on the primary factor level 1 vs factor level 2, hence the input order of factor levels is important. Here, DESeq2 computes fold changes of 'treated' samples against 'untreated' from the first factor 'Treatment', *i.e.* the values correspond to up- or downregulation of genes in treated samples.

    4. Standard error estimate for the log2 fold change estimate
    5. [Wald](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wald_test) statistic
    6. *p*-value for the statistical significance of this change
    7. *p*-value adjusted for multiple testing with the Benjamini-Hochberg procedure, which controls false discovery rate ([FDR](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/False_discovery_rate))

    > <tip-title>What are p-values and what are they used for?</tip-title>
    >
    > The p-value is a measure often used to determine whether or not a particular observation possesses statistical significance. Strictly speaking, the p-value is the probability that the data could have arisen randomly, assuming that the null hypothesis is correct. In the concrete case of RNA-Seq, the null hypothesis is that there is no differential gene expression. So a p-value of 0.13 for a particular gene indicates that, for that gene, assuming it is not differentially expressed, there is a 13% chance that any apparent differential expression could simply be produced by random variation in the experimental data.
    >
    > 13% is still quite high, so we cannot really be confident differential gene expression is taking place. The most common way that scientists use p-values is to set a threshold (commonly 0.05, sometimes other values such as 0.01) and reject the null hypothesis only for p-values below this value. Thus, for genes with p-values less than 0.05, we can feel safe stating that differential gene expression plays a role. It should be noted that any such threshold is arbitrary and there is no meaningful difference between a p-value of 0.049 and 0.051, even if we only reject the null hypothesis in the first case.
    >
    > Unfortunately, p-values are often heavily misused in scientific research, enough so that Wikipedia provides a [dedicated article](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Misuse_of_p-values) on the subject. See also [this article](https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/not-even-scientists-can-easily-explain-p-values/) (aimed at a general, non-scientific audience).

## Annotation of the DESeq2 results

The ID for each gene is something like ENSMUSG00000026581, which is an ID from the Ensembl gene database. These IDs are unique but sometimes we prefer to have the gene names, even if they may not reference an unique gene (e.g. duplicated after re-annotation). But gene names may hint already to a function or they help you to search for desired candidates. We would also like to display the location of these genes within the genome. We can extract such information from the annotation file which we uploaded before.

# Functional enrichment analysis of the DE genes

We have extracted genes that are differentially expressed in IR- vs. mock-treated samples. Now, we would like to know if the differentially expressed genes are enriched transcripts of genes which belong to more common or specific categories in order to identify biological functions that might be impacted.

## Gene Ontology analysis

[Gene Ontology (GO)](http://www.geneontology.org/) analysis is widely used to reduce complexity and highlight biological processes in genome-wide expression studies. However, standard methods give biased results on RNA-Seq data due to over-detection of differential expression for long and highly-expressed transcripts.

[**goseq**](https://bioconductor.org/packages/release/bioc/vignettes/goseq/inst/doc/goseq.pdf) ({% cite young2010gene %}) provides methods for performing GO analysis of RNA-Seq data while taking length bias into account. **goseq** could also be applied to other category-based tests of RNA-Seq data, such as KEGG pathway analysis, as discussed in a further section.

**goseq** needs 2 files as inputs:

- A tabular file with the differentially expressed genes from all genes assayed in the RNA-Seq experiment with 2 columns:
  - the Gene IDs (unique within the file), in uppercase letters
  - a boolean indicating whether the gene is differentially expressed or not (`True` if differentially expressed or `False` if not). We will use abs(2LogFC) > 2 as a criterion
- A file with information about the length of a gene to correct for potential length bias in differentially expressed genes


> 1. Use the _Gene length and GC content_ tool on the _Annotation file_ (gtf format). See this [screenshot](https://github.com/pacthoen/BMW2_RNA_clust_vis/blob/main/screenshots/Screenshot%202025-05-22%20210701.png)
>    - *"Analysis to perform"*: `gene lengths only`
> 2. Merge the gene length and the annotated DESeq2 ouput file **DESeq2 result file** with primary factor Treatment using the _Join two datasets side by side_ tool. In *"Keep the header lines"*: `No`. See this [Screenshot](https://github.com/pacthoen/BMW2_RNA_clust_vis/blob/main/screenshots/Screenshot%202025-05-22%20214135.png)
> 3. Use the _Compute on rows_ tool to create a column with TRUE and FALSE using the following expression: `bool(float(c3)>2)`. In the *"Error handling"* choose in *"Autodetect column types"* `No` and *"Fail on references to non-existent columns"* `No` and *"If an expression cannot be computed for a row"* choose `Fill in a replacement value` and Replacement value `False`. See this [screenshot](https://github.com/pacthoen/BMW2_RNA_clust_vis/blob/main/screenshots/Screenshot%202025-05-22%20222441.png)

**goseq** generates with these parameters 3 outputs:

1. A table (`Ranked category list - Wallenius method`) with the following columns for each GO term:

    1. `category`: GO category
    2. `over_rep_pval`: *p*-value for over-representation of the term in the differentially expressed genes
    3. `under_rep_pval`: *p*-value for under-representation of the term in the differentially expressed genes
    4. `numDEInCat`: number of differentially expressed genes in this category
    5. `numInCat`: number of genes in this category
    6. `term`: detail of the term
    7. `ontology`: MF (Molecular Function - molecular activities of gene products), CC (Cellular Component - where gene products are active), BP (Biological Process - pathways and larger processes made up of the activities of multiple gene products)
    8. `p.adjust.over_represented`: *p*-value for over-representation of the term in the differentially expressed genes, adjusted for multiple testing with the Benjamini-Hochberg procedure
    9. `p.adjust.under_represented`: *p*-value for under-representation of the term in the differentially expressed genes, adjusted for multiple testing with the Benjamini-Hochberg procedure

    To identify categories significantly enriched/unenriched below some p-value cutoff, it is necessary to use the adjusted *p*-value.

# Visualisation of high-dimensional datasets
In the second part of this computer assignment we will use commonly used techniques to identify the main sources of variation and to evaluate which samples and sample groups are most similar. We will continue using the same dataset but first filter for the most variable genes. This is for computational efficiency and to reduce the effect of noise.


## Filter for most variable genes
For filtering the most variable genes, we will compute the coefficient of variation (CV). This is defined as the standard deviation divided by the mean.

## Principal Component Analysis (PCA)
PCA is a dimension reduction technique to identify the main sources of variation. 
For this part of the assignment we will use the _multivariate_ tool{% icon tool %}. There is a separate [tutorial](https://training.galaxyproject.org/topics/metabolomics/tutorials/lcms-dataprocessing/tutorial.html#bibliography) for the _multivariate_ tool applied to metabolomics data.   

The tool needs a sampleMetadata file where the different groups / factors are defined. You will be able to colour the PCA score plots according to those groups. 
The tool needs a featureMetadata file with the names (and optional characteristics) of the genes. 

### Upload metadata

> 1. Create the featureMetadata file using the _cut_ tool on the `Input data for PCA and clustering` object
>    - *"Cut columns"*: c1
> 2. Import the count files from our [github repository](https://github.com/pacthoen/BMW2_RNA_clust_vis) using the Data Upload menu (top left) and the button _Paste/Fetch Data_. Indicate that the data files are `Tabular`. 
>    ```text
>    https://raw.githubusercontent.com/pacthoen/BMW2_RNA_clust_vis/refs/heads/main/data/GSE71176_sample_metadata.txt
>    ```
>    _Note_ Make sure that the order of the sample names in the data matrix and the sampleMetadata file are the same!
> 3. Run {% tool [Multivariate](toolshed.g2.bx.psu.edu/repos/ethevenot/multivariate/Multivariate/2.3.10) %} with the following parameters, according to this [Screenshot](https://github.com/pacthoen/BMW2_RNA_clust_vis/blob/main/screenshots/Screenshot%202025-05-23%20124140.png):
>    - {% icon param-file %} *"Data matrix file"*: `Input data for PCA and clustering` 
>    - {% icon param-file %} *"Sample metadata file"*: Your uploaded metadata
>    - {% icon param-file %} *"Variable metadata file"*: `Filtered_variableMetadata` (output of the last _cut_ job)
>    - *"Number of predictive components"*: `2`
>    - *"Advanced graphical parameters"*: `Full parameter list`
>        - *"Sample colors"*: `Treatment`
>        - *"Amount by which plotting text should be magnified relative to the default"*: `0.4`
>    - *"Advanced computational parameters"*: `Use default`
> 
>
>      

Among the four output files generated by the tool, the one we are interested in is the *Multivariate_figure.pdf* file.
The PCA scores plot representing the projection of samples on the two first components is located at the bottom left corner. The PCA loadings plot is located at the bottom right corner.

    >
    > 1. What is the cumulative percentage explained by the first two components.
    > 2. Which one of the two factors in the experiment has the largest effect on the gene expression levels: the genotype (TP53-/- or wild-type) or the exposure to IR? Play with the plot colors and shapes and create a figure that nicely visualizes this.

    >
    > > <solution-title></solution-title>
    > >
    > > 1.  The score plots contains the percentage of variance explained in the axis titles. Principal component t1  explains 51% of total variability and t2 18% of total variability. The cumulative variance explained by the first two components is 51+18 = 69%.
    > > 2. The t1 nicely separates the IR_treated cells from the mock-treated cells. t1 explains most of the variation thus IR treatment explains most of the variation. The t2 mainly separates the KO cells treated with IR, suggesting that KO cells respond differently to IR than WT cells, which makes sense because p53 is important for the response to IR.

> 4. Repeat the analysis but now with four principal components and plot principal component 3 at the x-axis (abscissa) and component 4 at the y-axis (ordinate)
> 5. Optional: one can also OPLS (Orthogonal Partial Least Squares) which is a supervised form of multivariate analysis


## Clustering

We will use the _heatmap2_ tool to perform the clustering of samples based on their mRNA expression patterns and evaluate the influence of different clustering algorithms (average linkage vs single linkage) and distance measures (Euclidean distance or Pearson correlation). See this [Screenshot](https://github.com/pacthoen/BMW2_RNA_clust_vis/blob/main/screenshots/Screenshot%202025-05-23%20152150.png)

> 1. Select as *"Input"* `Input data for PCA and clustering`
>    - *"Plot title"*: indicate the clustering algorithm and the distance measure used
>    - *"Data transformation"*: `Plot the data as is`. Because the data has already been VST normalized
>    - *"Compute Z-scores prior to clustering"*: `Compute on rows`. This brings all the genes on the same scale (mean zero and standard deviation. If you do not this (you can check!) the clustering will group high expressed genes together and low expressed together, whereas it is more interesting to cluster genes based on the differences seen between samples.
>    - *"Distance method"*: `Euclidean` OR `Pearson`
>    - *"Clustering method"*: `Average (=UPGMA)` OR `Single`
>    - *"Type of colormap to use"*: `Gradient with 3 colors`
>   
> 
    > <question-title></question-title>
    >
    > 1. How does the clustering of samples relate to the PCA results?
    > 2. Which differences do you observe between different clustering algorithms and different distance measures?
    > 3. Indicate the cluster of genes for which their IR response is p53-dependent. Are these genes mostly up- or downregulated after IR?

    >
    > > <solution-title></solution-title>
    > >
    > > 1. Again, the IR-exposed cells cluster separately from the mock-exposed cells. 
There is not much difference between the TP53-/- and wild-type mock-exposed cells, whilst the IR-exposed TP53-/- and wild-type cells cluster separately.
    > > 2. The clustering is not very dependent on the Distance measure used. However, with single linkage, it is much more difficult to identify discrete clusters, because the single, closest feature is added each time to an already existing cluster. Average and complete linkage methods usually start with finding the closest features that make up distinct clusters.
    > > 3. There is a cluster of genes that is only upregulated in the cells that are wild-type for p53 and not in IR-treated knockout cells. These mRNAs are dependent on p53 expression for their upregulation after exposure to IR.
